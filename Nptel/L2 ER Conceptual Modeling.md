# Conceptual Modeling

There are some other interesting constraints! these help to characterise the mapping relationships!

**Mapping Constraints:**

we got these mappings between two binary relationships,

1. One - One Mapping
2. One - Many
3. Many - One
4. Many - Many


One - One is like each element mapped to exactly one element in other set! like from 1st set element x mapped to element y from other set! but it does not mean that it should be mapped!

One - Many mean x can be mapped to more than one element from other set! but other set elements can be mapped to only one from first set!

Many - One is opposite of above!! 

Many - Many is allowes bother of above!! like many elements from 1st set can be mapped to many elements from other set!!

Now considering the element of Books to the Users how can we define these mapping constraints! lets see!

If On any entity we put the incoming arrow then the entity to other participate in one to one `or` one to many relationship!

But if we have dont mentioned or dont have an arraow! then that entity participate in many to one and many to many relationship!!

So if the book and User relationship has no arrows then they are in many to one or many to many relationships! and if both has arrows then they are either in one to one or one to many!!
