# Conceptual Modeling

There are some other interesting constraints! these help to characterise the mapping relationships!

**Mapping Constraints:**

we got these mappings between two binary relationships,

1. One - One Mapping
2. One - Many
3. Many - One
4. Many - Many


One - One is like each element mapped to exactly one element in other set! like from 1st set element x mapped to element y from other set! but it does not mean that it should be mapped!

One - Many mean x can be mapped to more than one element from other set! but other set elements can be mapped to only one from first set!

Many - One is opposite of above!! 

Many - Many is allowes bother of above!! like many elements from 1st set can be mapped to many elements from other set!!
