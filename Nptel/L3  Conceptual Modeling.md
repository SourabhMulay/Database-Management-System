# Conceptual Modeling

We already have learned about KEY attributes (Superkey, Candidate key, Primary Key).

Now lets learn Concept of **Generalisation!**.

Consider a **TICKET** (In railway reservation system) can have several Attributes. (ATTR: Ticket No, Start, Destination, Date Of Issue, Fare, Distance). So this makes a Ticket! Now if we wanted to distinguish the reserved ticket or unreserved ticket or a express Ticket or a Normal Ticket! Now differentiating can be possible in many ways. For example if we have one more attribute Reserved/Unreserved to just identify if ticket is reserved or not! but is it suffice???? nope! It still don't make any sense till we have information about, if reserved then which train, what seat no, if any extra fare charge?
