# Introduction to DBMS

A databse is collection of inter-related data which we called database and the second major component is set of software tools or programs which able to do operations on data like "acess the data" and "process the data". (often called query and update mechanism). 

Examples of information systems that requires the databases:

1. Bank systems
2. Library Information Systems (Book borrowing, Donating, Supplier, Issueing the books)
3. Railway/Airline Reservation Systems.

Before evolution of database these problems were solved using early information system where these systems directly uses the operating syetem which gives direct access to files!

**Early Information Systems (Method of Solution):**

In early systems you have many programs (suppose debiting, crediting, interest calculation, fix deposites) and these all programs can access the file system directly! and every OS gives you file system and same disk is shared between all!!
