# Relational Calculas

Now we have learned the relational algebra! and it helps us to get relations as an outcome of the operations we perform on them! Likely suppose you are projecting out some column from relation r where columna = 'z'. Likewise it return something as an outcome.

This is Procedural in nature means "what are the sequence of steps required to obtain the desired outcome".

**Relational Calculus is another language to define relations in a database. and It also forms Basis of Query Language. and It's Non-Procedural in some sense. So order to expressed it does not require the sequence of steps at some point.**

**Relational Calculas uses the concept of Formal Logic to express relational Queries.**

there are two well known formulations:

1. Tuple Relational Calculas
2. Domain Relational Calculas
