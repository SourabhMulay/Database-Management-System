# Relational Algebra

We'll Quickly review the relational model...

Suppose `K = (A,B,C)` and each is SET of Attributes.

For each we have domain of attributes and Domain of Attribute is defined as DOM(A), DOM(B), DOM(C).

`DOM(A) = {1,2,3}`

`DOM(B) = SET Of all Strings OF Length = 50`

`DOM(C) = {'Saurabh', 'Sarah'} `
