# ER MODEL (Entity-Relationship Model)

So model contain the entity, the attributes of entities and the relations!! and this is conceptual model to conceive the structure of database! and also it helps to identity the contraints that occur in integrated design of complete database system!

**Concept of Entity:**

An entity is a distinguishable object of a Database! (hmmmmm .... not fully get it right!)

Lets see some of the examples: (LIBRARY)

So in Library. Assume any perticular book,

**BOOK:**

`Compiler design by Aho,Ulimen ,pub by: addison wiseley, acc No: 732756, call no: 001-3276`

so this is clear distinguishable element of Library and it's one of the entities.

Another you can have,

**USER:**

`Ajay Kumar Singh, Project Staff, Cyrogenic Dept, Card No: c-124`

This is also a one of distinguishable entity of library!

another you can have,

**Supplier**

`M/S Narisa Book Distributor, 53 Syed, Amir ali Avenue, Cal-53`

and there might be several other entities!

So each such distinguishable object, which can be identify for perticular DB is called as an entity! So they can have same structure as a BOOK, PERSON, SUPPLIER, USER! 

**So all those entities which has same type or structure they form an Entity Set!**
