A new langs got introduced for db but most famous one was cobol.(comman business oriented lang) and FPS was most famous that time!!!

##### FPS (File processing System):

For example we have a Registeration dept , exam dept and the library dept. each dept has his own program and files. Now the problem here is suppose we have student name and roll no to save. This name and roll no must be comman in three but that was not the case with fps. and suppose the roll no changes or any one of students roll no changed and it does not reflected in exam dept but updated in other dept.

So this is redundant data!! that is the first problem and same data has stored at multiple location that is conflicting with each other...This is inconsistancy. and Inconsistency occur because of redundancy. Inconsistency cause by redendancy.

**Program Data inter dependancy :** We have desinged the application programs based on the files. Now if we changed any one of we need to change the other and it is interdependancy which is not logical at all.
So FPS rejected and DB approach got introduced where all programs controllled or reach to DBMS and DBMS integrated with shared Database. (Kind of shared collection). Relational data get stored (Logical data).DBMS is huge collection of softwares, It manages the users (security wise,who can acess what) and it manage the data.

**Advantage:**

1. Data sharing
2. Reduced Redundancy. (It reduces but not completely vanish)
3. Program data independance.
4. Better data Integrity.( Integrity mean Correct)
5. Better Data Consistency.
