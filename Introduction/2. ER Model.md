###### Entity - Relational Model: 

Is it complete??? Nope It ain't say any about the Storage (Format of data), Not about manipulation, and Not fully about the integrity Constraines. We'll create a HLD of database based on ER model and we'll use the relational database model to implement it. 

#### Entity:

Suppose in a company you will see a lot of people you call them employee. We call those people entitiy instances then the label "employee" is entity type and collection of all people is call entity set.
   

**Entity Type:** Name or label assigned to items or object exist in an environment and have similar properties. 

**Entity Instances:** perticular object belonging to perticular entity type.

**Entity Set:** Collection of all entity instances of perticular entity type.


We only have symbol for entity Types not for instances and sets. Further there are types of entity types...Symbol depends on entity types types...

1. Strong entity type (independant)
2. Weak Entity type. (Dependancies)

###### Strong Entities can exist independantly. Weak entities cannot exist without being linked with some other entities.

If entities has it's own primary key then it it strong. If not then weak! Strong entities types instances called as dominant instances and weak one called as subordinate Entity instances.

### Attributes In ER Model:
